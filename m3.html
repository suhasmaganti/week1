HIGHLIGHTS
THROW BACK. LAUNCH FORWARD.
Back to a classic. The 3.0-liter inline 6 makes a powerful return to this iteration of the M3. This weight-saving and balance-restoring powerhouse is updated with two TwinPower turbochargers and delivers 406 lb-ft of torque – a full 111lb-ft over the previous version.
SHED POUNDS.
Weight conscious. The M3 maintains an impressive power-to-weight ratio thanks to its Carbon Fiber roof and engine brace. An aluminum hood and front wheel arches keeps the pounds off to deliver exceptional handling, agility and dynamism on the road and the track.
WHITE-KNUCKLE WHEELS.
Power grip. Optional M Carbon Ceramic brakes4 use 6 pistons instead of the traditional 4 to boost stopping power. When paired with the now standard Adaptive M Suspension, this M is so agile you’ll want to hold on tighter.
SHOW OFF YOUR CURVES.
Preeminent performance. The quad-bank exhaust system with chrome-plated tips paired with flared rear wheel arches that accommodate a wide stance give the M3 a powerful aesthetic that hints at heightened stability and unparalleled cornering.
THE CABIN FEELS NATURAL.
Designed for drivers. The cabin features a tilted center console that intuitively places every control at your fingertips. A leather-wrapped dash and M-specific instrument cluster with engine warning lights highlight the high-end sport function of its performance-driven design.
PARADIGM SHIFT.
Gear up like a pro. The M Double-clutch Transmission with Drivelogic provides instantaneous track-inspired shifts, but for the purists who want an analog connection to the road, a 6-speed manual transmission comes standard.
DIFFERENTIAL DIFFERENCE.
Feel each wheel. The Active M Differential uses Dynamic Stability Control data, pedal position, wheel rotation, and yaw rate to act on each wheel before any of them break free. An electric motor varies power distribution between wheels, shifting it in tight turns, and even decreasing understeer during full-load cornering.
